# Obsidian Uni Notes Plugin

**Uni Notes** allows users to extract images and text from a `.pdf` file and link them together in a `.md` file. 

![ReadMe Demo](readme-assets/demo.gif)

Supported Input file types:
- `.pdf`

Supported output file types:
-  `.png`
### Installation
**Uni Notes** is available from the Obsidian Community Plugins repository, or can be cloned from this repo directly into the `.obsidian/plugins` folder inside your vault.

##  ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
-  This plugin is currently **desktop only**
- The [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor) plugin must be installed and enabled for Uni Notes to work. Text Extractor requires an internet connection, so OCR will not work offline in Uni Notes.
- Currently, Uni Notes only contains one tool. However, the aim is to create a tool suite based on problems I encounter when note taking. Features will be added whenever a problem is uncovered.

# Obsidian Uni Notes Plugin

**Uni Notes** allows users to extract images and text from a `.pdf` file and link them together in a `.md` file. Users can customise tags, select output directories, and set default behaviour in the settings.

![ReadMe Demo](readme-assets/demo.mp4)

Supported Input file types:
- `.pdf`

Supported output file types:
-  `.png`

### Installation
**Uni Notes** can be cloned from this repo directly into the `.obsidian/plugins` folder inside your vault. (Or will be available from the Obsidian Community Plugins repository soon).

##  ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️
-  This plugin is  **desktop only**
- The [Text Extractor](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor) plugin must be installed and enabled for Uni Notes to work. Text Extractor requires an internet connection, so OCR will not work offline in Uni Notes.
- Support for further file types is in progress.
